Define variable length = 20
Define variable default_value = 5000

Define array called og_array
Fill first half of og_array with 0
Fill second half of og_array with default_value

Define function repeat_again(given_array):
    Calculate the average of given_array and store it in mean
    For each value in given_array:
        If the value is more than 10% above or below the mean:
            Return True
    Return False

Repeat the following steps forever:
    Define new array called newarray with 20 zeroes

    For each index from 0 to length - 1:
        For each ball (from 0 to og_array[index]):
            Pick a random number a (either 0 or 1)

            If index is the first position (0):
                If a is 1, increase newarray[index + 1] by 1
                Else, increase newarray[index] by 1

            Else if index is the last position (length - 1):
                If a is 0, increase newarray[index - 1] by 1
                Else, increase newarray[index] by 1

            Else (for all middle positions):
                If a is 0, increase newarray[index - 1] by 1
                Else, increase newarray[index + 1] by 1

    Set og_array = newarray
    Print og_array

    If repeat_again(og_array) is False:
        Break the loop

Print the final og_array
